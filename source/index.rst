Welcome!
========

Welcome to my personal website!
I'm a PhD specialized in signal and image processing,
as well as an engineer specialized in software development focused on optimization, parallelization and efficiency.

As an employee of CNES, the French space agency, I mostly work in the frame of large space missions like Euclid or Lisa.
Prior to this, I used to apply my signal and image processing knowledge to the biomedical field as an intern (epidemiology) and PhD student (cell biology).
When I was sooo young, I have also spent a year in the aeronautical industy.

This website is like an extended Curriculum Vitae.
